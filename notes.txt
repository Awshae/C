Int = 2/4 bytes %d
Char = 1 byte %c
Float = 4 bytes %f
double/long float = 8 bytes %lf
long float = 10 bytes %Lf

0 is 48 in ASCII
null is /o or 0
null = 0 , 0 NOT null

printing sizeof(null) gets 1 as output.

if float x = 10.1 and all itll always become double float. BUT 0.5 is acted like a whole number itself.

Binary, octal etc etc .
